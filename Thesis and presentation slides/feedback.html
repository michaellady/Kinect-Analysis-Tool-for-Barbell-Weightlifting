<h1>Feedback</h1><hr />
<p>This is a nice project. The student successfully developed software analysing posture during weightlifting using a Kinect.<br/><br/>Positives:<br/><br/>This is a good project in terms of software implementation. Parsing the Kinect output and constructing an interface for video and 3-D skeleton playback is not trivial and the student made a good job of it.<br/>The student clearly understands the problem at hand and has done some good research into the options for sensing. He lost time in not considering the Kinect at an earlier stage and that is a shame, although it could be argued that given the high profile of the latter he should have been aware of it.<br/>A limited evaluation has been attempted and in places there is evidence that the student has thought about the challenges involved.<br/>The thesis is well presented and well structured – easy to read and follow. <br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>The technical contributions in terms of data analysis are weak and as such the potential of the project is not fully realised. For example, the use of ‘weight lifter models’ and training data could have been considered and more exploration of interface issues for enabling lift comparisons could have been done.<br/>There is limited or no discussion, description or evaluation of the claimed technical contributions – the auto alignment method and the simulation of side-view display.<br/>The evaluation of the system and its parts is brief and very limited – no experimentation over multiple data sets or accompanying analysis. Hence it is not clear how well the system works or how robust it is.<br/>Thesis adopts a diary approach in many places, ‘then I did this’, etc, rather than objective analysis and discussion.<br/><br/>Overall: A good 2:1 project but not sufficient extra to warrant a 1st class mark.<br/></p>
