Kinect-Analysis-Tool-for-Barbell-Weightlifting
==============================================

The aim of this project is to design and implement a software tool that will provide useful  feedback for weightlifters wishing to improve their performance in the barbell deadlift. The tool  will provide automatic feedback on lifts captured by a Microsoft Kinect 3D camera. It will  exploit the Kinect's skeletisation capabilities to extract relevant joint angles in order to allow the  comparison of different lifts. If the subject performs a set of lifts one after the other then the tool  will identify where each individual lift starts and stops to make comparison easier. It enables  recording of the weightlifting sessions with automatic detection and tracking of human body  joints, extracting relevant information such as angles of human body joints from the lift, as well  as analysis, evaluation and comparison with other lifts. It also allows the user to evaluate the  performance of their lifts without the company of professional coaches which helps boosting weightlifting performance.
